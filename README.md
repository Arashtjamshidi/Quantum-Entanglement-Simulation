# Quantum-Entanglement-Simulation
Conducted numerical simulations of random two-qubit states to compute the volume of entangled states.
Evaluated using various measures: entropy criterion, Horodecki boundary, PPT, negativity, and concurrence.
Analyzed the correlation and efficiency of different entanglement measures relative to each other.
Implemented using Python under the supervision of Prof. Seyed Javad Akhtarshenas.
